<b>Life is given to us,
we earn it bygiving it,</b>

<i>Let the dead have the immortality of fame,
but the living the immortality of love,</i>
     
<em>Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty
that can modulate their isolation into a</em>
     
harmony mith the mhole,

life,like a child,laughs,
shaking its rattle of death as it run,</pre></p>
